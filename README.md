## Introduction

Just like MyAnimeList (MAL), this website aims at helping its users to find, share and store data regarding TV series and movies that were watched.
This is done with the help of [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api), which contains data from various shows, including its title, genre, synopsis, etc.

## Features

-   User authentication and registration: Allow users to create accounts, sign in, and manage their profiles.
-   Watchlists: Allow users to create and manage watchlists of TV series and movies they want to watch.
-   Search and browse: Allow users to search and browse for TV series and movies based on title, genre, actors, directors, etc.
-   Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations to users based on their watch history, ratings, and preferences.
-   Reviews and ratings: Allow users to rate and review TV series and movies they have watched.

## Build and Run

Don't forget to edit the `.env.example` file with your data and copy it to `.env`, both in the api folder and in the database folder.
You can do that automatically (copying the default values from the example) by running

```sh
make default-env-files
```

Then, to build and run, use the following commands:

```sh
make build && make up
```

Since we're using nodemon, you don't need to restart the containers for every change in the code.

## Run API tests

```sh
make test
```
