# MC426A-TV-Application

## Summary
This repository will be used in the course MC426 (Software Engineering) at Unicamp. The idea of the project is to create an application that will allow the user to create watchlists of TV Series and Movies, and interact adding recommendations, reviews, etc.

## Introduction
Just like MyAnimeList (MAL), this website aims at helping its users to find, share and store data regarding TV series and movies that were watched.
This is done with the help of [TVDB API](https://thetvdb.com/api-information), which contains data from various shows, including its title, genre, synopsis, etc.

## Features
- User authentication and registration: Allow users to create accounts, sign in, and manage their profiles.
- Watchlists: Allow users to create and manage watchlists of TV series and movies they want to watch.
- Search and browse: Allow users to search and browse for TV series and movies based on title, genre, actors, directors, etc.
- Recommendations: Provide personalized recommendations to users based on their watch history, ratings, and preferences.
- Reviews and ratings: Allow users to rate and review TV series and movies they have watched.
- Social features: Allow users to follow other users, share their watchlists, and see what their friends are watching.
- Notifications: Send users notifications about new episodes or movies they might be interested in.
