# MC426A-TV-Application

## Summary
This repository will be used in the course MC426 (Software Engineering) at Unicamp. The idea of the project is to create an application that will allow the user to create watch lists of TV Series and Movies, and interact adding recommendations, reviews, etc.

## Introduction
Just like MyAnimeList (MAL), this website aims at helping its users to find, share and store data regarding TV series and movies that were watched.
This is done with the help of [TVDB API](https://thetvdb.com/api-information), which contains data from various shows, including its synopsis, actors, categories, etc.
